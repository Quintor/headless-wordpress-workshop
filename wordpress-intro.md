# Wordpress Introduction

You might have heard that WordPress is the world’s most popular method to create your own website or blog. And perhaps you’re anxious to use it to profile your business or organization, share stories and ideas, or build a community. Or possibly you’re considering diving into the world of web design professionally and are ready to get up to speed on the platform everyone’s raving about.

According to [W3Techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress), WordPress currently powers 43% — or more than one third — of all websites on the internet. If you want to consider just sites running an open-source Content Management System (CMS), that jumps to a whopping 62% of the market share, or close to two thirds.

Now used by everyone from individuals to large businesses, WordPress is popular thanks to a number of benefits, including:

Numerous customization options

- A search engine-friendly system
- Open-source creation with free use by anyone
- Extensibility facilitated by many easily installed third-party elements
- A quick-to-learn, comprehensive environment allowing non-programmers to manage their own content, settings, and user experience
