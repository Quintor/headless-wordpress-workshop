# WordPress as a Headless CMS

In layman’s terms, headless WordPress refers to a situation in which you use WordPress to backend your web-application while using another technology to build the front-end.

In essence, you can manage the front-end and backend as separate instances. Hence, this implies that you can create content, pages, and posts in the familiar WordPress environment. However, you do not depend on it for front-end visualization.

Headless WordPress is a departure from the conventional server-side apps. The application interface is created and managed directly in the client browser instead of on the server. The browser’s JavaScript application creates this interface after extracting content from WordPress. This is also known as client-side or decoupled development.

Doing this lets you surpass WordPress’s PHP-based interface, which is its front-end. The body, which is the actual CMS, is controlled by an external app remotely. This type of app development is also known as API-driven development, as the API takes care of the communication between the web app and the server-side CMS.

WordPress APIs use HTTP web addresses, also called endpoints, to enable software communication. These endpoints look like regular web addresses and accept several requests like GET information, POST information requests, etc.
